Attack Vectors

An attack vector is the method or technique used to compromise a system. Think of it as the weapon an attacker uses.

Common attack vectors include:

• Phishing emails  
• Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attacks  
• Web drive by attacks  
• Exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities

Each vector targets a specific weakness in technology or human behavior.

Attack Surface

The attack surface is every possible point where an attacker could interact with or exploit a system.

Examples include:

• Email servers  
• Internet facing web servers  
• End user workstations  
• Humans susceptible to social engineering

The larger the attack surface, the more opportunities attackers have.

Attack Surface Reduction

Attack surface reduction focuses on minimizing exposure. You cannot remove the attack surface entirely, but you can reduce it to make attacks harder and less effective.

Examples of reduction techniques:

• Disabling unnecessary services  
• Closing unused network ports  
• Enforcing least privilege access  
• Keeping systems patched  
• Reducing publicly exposed infrastructure
