Day 2 introduces the fundamentals of logging and log analysis. Logs are one of the most important data sources in cybersecurity, especially for detection, investigation, and incident response. In this task, we analyze captured log files to trace malicious activity and identify evidence left behind by the Bandit Yeti APT.

## Learning Objectives

In this task, you will:

• Understand what log files are and why they matter  
• Identify valuable information commonly stored in logs  
• Learn where log files are typically stored  
• Use basic Linux commands to analyze logs  
• Track attacker activity through real log data

## What Are Log Files and Why Are They Useful

Log files are records of events generated by systems, applications, and services. Each entry represents something that happened at a specific time and place. Examples of events commonly found in logs include:

• Successful and failed login attempts  
• Network traffic and connection details  
• Accessed files, URLs, or endpoints  
• Password changes  
• Application errors and crashes

Because logs provide a historical timeline, they are critical during investigations. They allow analysts to answer key questions such as:

• What happened?  
• When did it happen?  
• Where did it happen?  
• Who initiated the action?  
• Was the action successful?

Logs often serve as primary evidence during incident response and forensic analysis.

## Getting Started

Deploy the machine associated with the task and open the split screen view to access the terminal.

No answer is required for this step.

## Identifying Available Log Files

List the files in the current directory using the ls command:

`ls`

The output shows two log files present in the directory.

**Answer:** 2

## Identifying the Web Server Log

From the file listing, identify the log file generated by the web server.

The relevant file is clearly labeled as:

**Answer:** webserver.log

## Investigating the Web Server Log

At this stage, begin examining the contents of webserver.log to identify suspicious activity related to the theft of Santa’s naughty and nice list.

No answer is required for this step.

## Determining the Day of the Attack

Search the web server log for references to Santa using grep:

`grep -i -r "santa" webserver.log`

The output reveals that the file santaslist.txt was accessed via a GET request on 18 November 2022. Checking the calendar confirms that this date falls on a Friday.

**Answer:** Friday

## Identifying the Attacker’s IP Address

The same grep output shows the source IP address responsible for the malicious GET request.

**Answer:** 10.10.249.191

## Identifying the Stolen File

From the log entry, the attacker accessed and retrieved the following file:

**Answer:** santaslist.txt

## Finding the Flag in the Logs

Search all log files for the flag format using grep:

`grep -r "THM"`

This command reveals the hidden flag within the logs.

**Answer:** THM{STOLENSANTASLIST}
